Overview
Build systems and models that drive decision making and learn from data.
Machine Learning Engineers are key to future decision-making in any data-driven company.
Work with Some of the Best
Our support team have been there and done that - they are experienced practitioners of data science in various fields such as Utilities, Retail and Financial Services; with a solid academic background.
Learn How to Solve Problems
The course is built around solving actual problems whilst learning about the latest machine learning techniques.
Apply the skills
EXPLORE prides itself on the practicality of the course. Participants must be able to apply the skills/knowledge that they acquired to do amazing things.
Extended Access To Material
Participants will have extended access to the material that are covered in the course, allowing them to revisit the techniques to keep it fresh in their mind. 
Curriculum
Start thinking like a machine learning engineer
The course will start by covering the basics of programming in python - building functions to automate analysis. After the foundations have been set, participants will master the model building process and the various machine learning algorithms to use when predicting or classifying personal loans as well as exploring techniques such as clustering and natural language processing. In the final phase, participants will dive deeper into the more complex machine learning techniques - deep learning, where they will cover all the various neural networks.
Participants will learn to code in python. From basic syntax to complex logic statements and functions. They will also cover utilising external libraries to make programming simpler - going very deep into the NUmpy and Pandas libraries.
Able to write basic python code and debug errors
Able to write logic statements and for-loops
Able to write functions to code efficiently
Able to import and use libraries such as Numpy and Pandas
Participants will cover the whole model building process using python’s Sci-kit Learn library. They will start by pre-processing the data to be ready for modeling and then go through the machine learning algorithms for classifying whether someone will take out a loan or not. Then it will be all about regression algorithms to predict the amount of the loan for those who took out a loan. Secondly, they will look at unsupervised learning algorithms which will be combined with Natural Language processing techniques. Finally, participants will cover three deep learning algorithms - Artificial Neural Nets, Convolutional Neural Nets and Recurrent Neural Nets. They will build models using these algorithms in python’s Keras library - for some of these algorithms the data will be transformed.
Able to pre-process data ready for modeling purposes
Understand the concepts of regression, classification and unsupervised learning
Able to build and optimise models using python’s Sci-kit Learn library
Able to select the most important features for model building
Able to process text using NLP techniques
Able to cluster data using clustering algorithms
Understand the structure of neural nets and when to use them
Able to build deep learning models in Keras
Able to transform data into images and vice versa  Overview

Why Machine Learning?
Make better decisions and smart actions in real time without human intervention
Four megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our world:
Vast amounts of data are being generated every minute. 
The processing speed of our machines is increasing exponentially.
We now have cloud providers who can store insane amounts of data for a few dollars.
Powerful open source algorithms that can read, write, translate and see are now available to everyone.
All of these things above mean that it’s becoming easier and quicker to produce models that can analyze bigger/more complex data and deliver more accurate results – even on a very large scale. By building prediction models a business has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks.  Overview
