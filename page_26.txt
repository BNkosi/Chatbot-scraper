Why Visualise?
Turn complex problems into simple visuals
Complex technologies and programming languages involved in data science make it hard for non-technical people to understand it. That’s when data visualization comes into play and allows those less technical to grasp what is being said.
Dashboards enable us to create this visual story. Power BI has been one of the leaders in the industry when it comes to dashboarding software.  Overview
