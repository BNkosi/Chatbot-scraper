Curriculum
Start thinking like a machine learning engineer
Students will master the model building process and the various machine learning algorithms to use when predicting or classifying. For those not born programmers, there will be material to cover the basics of programming in python.
Students will learn to code in python. From basic syntax to complex logic statements and functions. They will also cover utilising external libraries to make programming simpler.
Able to write basic python code and debug errors
Able to write logic statements and for-loops
Able to write functions to code efficiently
Able to import and use libraries such as Numpy and Pandas
Students will cover the whole model building process using python’s Sci-kit Learn library. They will start by pre-processing the data to be ready for modelling and then go through the machine learning algorithms.
Able to pre-process data ready for modeling purposes
Understand the concepts of regression, classification and unsupervised learning
Able to build models using python’s Sci-kit Learn library
Able to fine tune and optimise models
Able to select the most important features for model building
Able to cluster data  Overview

Why Machine Learning?
Make better decisions and smart actions in real time without human intervention
Four megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our world:
Vast amounts of data are being generated every minute. 
The processing speed of our machines is increasing exponentially.
We now have cloud providers who can store insane amounts of data for a few dollars.
Powerful open source algorithms that can read, write, translate and see are now available to everyone.
All of these things above mean that it’s becoming easier and quicker to produce models that can analyze bigger/more complex data and deliver more accurate results – even on a very large scale. By building prediction models a business has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks.  Overview
